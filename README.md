My phase two project is an application that stores and displays corporate jargon phrases while allowing users to enter new ones.

On the home page, the title header loads along with a random term card from the dictionary tab. The dictionary tab is a list of the terms already added to the database. The add a new term tab opens up a form that allows the user to enter in a new term, definition, sentence, and a gif or image if they would like.

After cloning, please run npm install to download the dependencies. Then npm runserver to start the local server, and npm start to host the application locally.

To make this project happen, I used the wikipedia page for business terms and giphy for the gifs.
